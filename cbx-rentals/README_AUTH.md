# CBX Rentals Authentication & Initial Data Setup

## Completed Tasks

### 1. SQL Migration for Initial Data
Created `/supabase/migrations/004_load_initial_data.sql` that:
- Loads 4 properties with addresses and listing URLs
- Loads 24 attendees with contact info and transportation preferences
- Creates bookings linking attendees to properties
- Sets all bookings as unpaid initially

To run the migration:
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or directly in Supabase SQL editor
# Copy and paste the contents of 004_load_initial_data.sql
```

### 2. Authentication Implementation

#### Dependencies Installed
- `zustand` - For state management

#### Files Created

1. **Auth Store** (`/src/stores/authStore.ts`)
   - Manages authentication state
   - Persists session in sessionStorage
   - Validates credentials against environment variables

2. **Login Form** (`/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`)
   - Uses Shadcn UI components
   - Form validation with react-hook-form and zod
   - Toast notifications for success/error states

3. **Protected Route** (`/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
   - Wraps protected routes
   - Redirects to login if not authenticated

4. **Pages**
   - Login Page (`/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
   - Dashboard Page (`/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`)

### 3. Routing Structure

Updated `App.tsx` with:
- `/login` - Public login page
- `/` - Protected dashboard (redirects to login if not authenticated)

### 4. Environment Configuration

Created `.env.local` with:
```
VITE_AUTH_USERNAME=cbxadmin
VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD=CBX2025$ecure
```

Also created `.env.example` for documentation.

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown)

3. You'll be redirected to `/login`

4. Login with:
   - Username: `cbxadmin`
   - Password: `CBX2025$ecure`

5. After successful login, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

## Security Notes

- The `.env.local` file is gitignored and should never be committed
- Change the default password in production
- Authentication is currently static (checking against env variables)
- Session is stored in sessionStorage (cleared when browser tab closes)

## Next Steps

- Connect to Supabase for data fetching
- Implement property, attendee, and booking management pages
- Add more detailed dashboard analytics
- Implement payment tracking functionality
